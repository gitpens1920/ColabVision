## AWS instance
Should there be issues with using Colab, the secondary path would be to follow the write up below:

The project will primarially utilize python for algorithms and to get the Colab instances up and running. 

# Initial Test

I am primarily running a W11 machine and Ubuntu.

## Test 1: Google Colab up and running
[] Validate that CloudFlare tunneling is need OR is there a different path to TurboVNC Viewer work...(not a huge fan of sourceforge).
[] Install cloudflared
[] Consider using Colab and AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/ (interesting cost advantage and no local installation of SW!!)
