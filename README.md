# Readme

This project is to document and recorded the data to run a google colab Carla(TM) server to use either a separate instance of colab or a local computer vision image algorithm for students and/or hobbists. Enjoy!

Of note, I will be following https://github.com/MichaelBosello/carla-colab who originally gave me the idea, but I had difficulty in getting it to work, so I am documenting the steps I took/updates I made so I can go back and recommend a correction/updates should everything work as I had hoped.

### AWS Carla

Testing the Carla interface on an AWS instance such that a "specific" computer install isn't that complicated.
