Short answer
- 170GB free drive space
- 8GB GPU

Basic steps:
1. Install CARLA packages on server

This requires ~17GB of space and ultimately will be very RAM intensive when running. A micro server will download and install it, but will not be able to run the SW without significant lag.

2. Install the remote server packages
