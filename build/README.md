## AWS instance
Should there be issues with using Colab, the secondary path would be to follow the write up below:

# SW plans

The project will primarially utilize python for algorithms and to get the Colab instances up and running. 

## Initial Test

I am primarily running a W11 machine and Ubuntu.

[X] Test: Google Colab up and running

- [Not achieved] External connection to Colab...

[X] Test: Image detection model

[X] Test: AWS Ubuntu free tier

[Acheived - not video output] Test: AWS Ubuntu Carla running

[Not achieved] Test: AWS Ubuntu VPC to Google Colab (SSH most likely)

[N/A] Test: AWS Ubuntu Image Recognition model

[N/A] Test: AWS Ubuntu Carla to AWS Ubuntu Image Recognition model running (SSH most likely)
