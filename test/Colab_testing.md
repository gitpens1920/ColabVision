# Colab Tests

Colab testing was abandoned after diving deeper into the need to "Install cloudflared on your PC" was required to remote or tunnel into the Colab instance. Essentially, the cloudflared installation is a type of DNS or VPS routing and encryption which more or less routes all traffic through cloudfare servers. As this would be ill-advised for anyone looking to utilize this setup for any IP or potental commercial application it was not longer aviable option. 

The Colab CARLA instance was able to be started and run, but remoting into and viewing the CARLA video application was not achieved due to the above issue. 

It took ~30 minutes to an hour to start the Colab notebook and compile/install the python packages and CARLA software.
